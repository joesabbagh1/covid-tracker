# covid-tracker

## APIs used
For the news section, I used my own API https://rapidapi.com/joesabbagh1/api/covid-19-news5/ which returns around a dozen of news articles from different media outlets.
For the covid data, I used https://rapidapi.com/Yatko/api/coronavirus-map/, the data was displayed using different types of graphs. (Sadly the api is down, so I stoped working on the project)
